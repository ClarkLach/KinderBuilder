This is being created for usage in a kindergarten classroom.

I intend to create a simple webapp that allows users to drag and drop words from a word bank to form sentences. I suspect this is a good opportunity to learn JS/TS, React, and Tailwind.

To-Do: 

Sort words by first letter. Alphabet on sidebar instead of word list, click on a letter to view words.

Would be neat to AI generate images for nouns and store them in a DB, maybe, maybe not.

Make words rearrangeable within the sentence box, ideally drag and drop, but not with HTML5 API

Admin view to allow an instructor to selects specific words to be used (set default, upload images?, control over word themes, etc)

Landing Page, possibly with admin login, theme selection?

Utilize React and Tailwind??

Dolch Sight words specifically.

Dream Goals: 

Some sort of grammar checking. I'm sure there's a million ways to do this, but how can I do it creatively that will benefit a 5-year-old? 

Categories of nouns.
