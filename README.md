This is being created for usage in a kindergarten classroom.

I intend to create a simple webapp that allows users to form sentences from a word bank. I suspect this is a good opportunity to learn JS/TS, React, and Tailwind.

To-Do: 

Make words rearrangeable within the sentence box with drag and drop, but not with the HTML5 API. Needs to work on touch screens.

Sort words by first letter. Alphabet on sidebar instead of word list, click on a letter to view words.

Admin view to change words, categories, export completed sentences)

Prompt user for name on landing page

Submit sentences and store in a central text file (or DB?).


Dream Goals: 

Grammar Checking

Images for nouns?

Categories of nouns
