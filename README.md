This is being created for usage in a kindergarten classroom.

I intend to create a simple webapp that allows users to drag and drop words from a word bank to form sentences. I suspect this is a good opportunity to learn JS/TS, React, and Tailwind.

To-Do: Figure out how to import a list of words and autofill them onto the page, currently need unique ID's per draggable element This includes importing images. Would be neat to AI generate images for nouns and store them in a DB, maybe, maybe not.

Make words change form in the sentence box, make them look like sentences and not just an assortment of boxes

Admin view to allow an instructor to selects specific words to be used (set default, upload images?, control over word themes, etc)

Landing Page, possibly with admin login, theme selection?

Learn more CSS/Tailwind and make this actually look nice lol

Mess around with React which will hopefully make this a bit easier

Dolch Sight words specifically.

Manually add words, either create and drag in, or drag in empty box that can be typed in

Dream Goals: 

Some sort of grammar checking. I'm sure there's a million ways to do this, but how can I do it creatively that will benefit a 5-year-old? 

Categories of nouns.
